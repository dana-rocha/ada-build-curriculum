# Ada Programming Languages

Programming languages exist so that humans can give instructions to computers. It's all about communication. 

## Classification

There are two main ways to classify programming languages: by level and by type (compiled or interpreted).

## Level
The "level" of a language describes how close the language is to being binary code. Binary code is a two-symbol system that computers use to represent text or other data - just by using 0's and 1's. 

Low-level languages, such as C, are more difficult for humans to read than other programming languages. In comparison, high-level languages (such as Java, Python, and Ruby) tend to be more abstract and easier for humans to read. High-level languages take care of more of the background tasks for the software developer. 

## Type (Compiled or Interpreted)
Compiled lanuages are converted into binary code before they are executed. These include C, C++, and Java to name a few.

Interpreted languages can be translated or executed directly. The code does not get directly converted into binary. The program that runs the code is the one that communicates directly with the computer. These languages include Python, Ruby, PHP, JavaScript.
