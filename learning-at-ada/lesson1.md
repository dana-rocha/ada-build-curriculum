Software developers don't have all the answers. A good portion of their time is spent searching for references for the answers. Common tools are StackOverflow and Google. 

### Tips

* Add "example" in your query 
* Add the specific language you are coding in 
* Use double quotations for an exact match
* Make sure to check the date of what you are referencing
