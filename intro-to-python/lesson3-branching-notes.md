## Relational Operators

Relational operators allow us to compare 2 or more values. 
* In Python, we can use relational operators on all numbers and strings. Additionally, we can use equals and does not equal on lists and dictionaries. 
* Equals sign = is the assignment operator. This is very very different than double equals sign == which is the EQUALITY operator. 
* The result of a relational operator (True or False) is known as a boolean. 
* Relational operators can be chained together like: 0 < x <= 100 or 10 > x > 1 

## Conditionals
Conditional statements allow our programs to take different paths based on different inputs. To create conditional statements, we use the if, elif, and else keywords. 

Indentation is very important for conditional statements. They must be properly indented in order to execute. 

Each indented section of code is called a block. Each block describes the behavior the code performs for each different condition.
