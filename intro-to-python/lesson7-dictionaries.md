# Dictionaries
Ada Build - Intro to Python: Lesson 7 

## Overview
Dictionaries are common Python data structure types. They are similar to lists but let us store and retieve values using integer indices. Dictionaries use key-value pairs. 

We can initialize an empty Dictionary using curly braces {} or the dict() function.

### Dictionaries with Data
The data in a dictionary consists of key-value pairs. Each key-value pair in a dictionary is reffered to as an item. The order of the key-value pairs is not guaranteed so a dictionary is a collection of unordered items.* 

* However, starting from Python 3.7, insertion order of Python dictionaries is guranteed.
