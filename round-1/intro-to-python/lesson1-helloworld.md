# Hello, World!
Ada Built - Intro to Python: Lesson 1

## Google Colab
Colab is Google's hosting of Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. Uses for Jupyter Notebook include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning and more. 
## Hello, World!
Traditionally, a "Hello, World!" program is the first program that people often write when exploring a new programming language. It can also be used as a sanity test to make sure that a computer language is correctly installed. 

### What is print?
print is a function that prints the specified argument to the screen. For the code we just wrote print("Hellow, World") the argument is the string "Hello, World". A string is any collection of character enclosed with quotation marks " ". In Python, functions are invoked using parenthesis () with zero or more arguments inside. 
## Keyboard Shortcuts
It's faster to use keyboard shortcuts to do common tasks such as uncommenting, executing, and re-commenting lines of code. 
### Uncomment, Execute, Re-comment
Use the "command" key and / key at the same time to comment a whole line. If it's already a comment, command / will remove the comment mark. 
### Execute code in block
To run or re-run a code block , press command enter. 
## Python REPL
Python provides an interactive computer program that allows the user to enter Python code and get results of that code immediately. This feature is known as REPL (read, evaluate, print loop). This kind of program is great for trying out new commands, practicing syntax, and evaluating solutions to small problems. This is one of two primary ways to use Python to interact with a computer. The other is to put Python code into a file and then ask the comptuer to read and execute the code in the file. 

## Reflection
With the two code block examples provided, the first code block has two print statements that print the two sentences out individually but the second code block prints both sentences out in one line. A newline character is specified in between the sentences. This example shows that there are many ways to use print statements.
