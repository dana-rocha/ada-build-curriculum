# Hello, World!

Ada Build - Intro to Python: Lesson 1


## Google Colab

The 'Learning to Code' portion of the Ada Build Curriculum is made up of notes and exercises in Google Colab. Colab is Google's hosting of Jupyter Notebook, an open-source web application that allows users to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and text. 

Uses for Jupyter Notebook include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and more. 

### Text Cells

Text cells in Colab are written in a markup language called 'markdown'. 

## Hello, World!

A 'Hello, World' program is the first program that people often write when exploring a new programming language. It's a simple program that is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language. The tradition of using the phrase 'Hello, World!' as a test message can be traced back to 1978. 

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Uncomment, Execute, Re-comment
Professional developers minimize their use of the mouse (or trackpad) as much as possible. Keyboard navigation is much more predictable and precise. 

* Comment + Uncomment - Command Slash (Ctrl /)
* Run Code Block - Command Enter


## Python REPL
Python provides an interactive computer program that allows the user to enter Python code and immediately get results of that code. This feature is known as REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print Loop). This program is great for trying out new commands, practicing syntax, and evaluating solutions to small problems.
