# Lesson 0

## Overview

- The Build curriculum primarily focuses on learning Python
- The classroom curriculum teaches some other programming languages
- Why are there so many programming languages? Are some languages better at certain things than others?
- Programming languages exist so that humans can give instructions to computers. 
- Programming is about communication
- Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages - there's idioms, dialects, grammar, colloquialisms

## Classification
There are two main ways to classify a programming language: by level or by type (compiled or interpreted)

### By Level
The level describes how close the language is to binary code. Binary code is the
language that computers use internally - made up of 0's and 1's. Low-level
languages, like C, tend to be more difficult for humans to read than other
languages. 

There also also high-level languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby.
High level languages do more of the background tasks for the software developer.

### By Type (compiled or interpreted)
Compiled languages such as C, C++, and Java are converted into binary code
before they are executed.

Interpreted languages can be translated or directly
executed. The code does not get directly converted to binary, the program that
runs the code is the one that communicates direectly with the computer. 

Compiled and interpreted languages can be further divided into dynamically typed and statically typed languages.

Statically typed languages do type checking (verifying/enforcing constraints of types) at compile-time instead of run-time.

Dynamicaly typed languages do type checking at run-time instead of compile-time. 


## Languages

### Python

Python = high-level, dynamically typed language. Created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. 

Python can be run on a variety of platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc) and is straightforward in terms of syntax. It's syntax is similar to that of the English language. It was designed to be powerful, intuitive, and open source.
