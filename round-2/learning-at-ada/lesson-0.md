# Lesson 0

## Overview

- The Build curriculum primarily focuses on learning Python
- The classroom curriculum teaches some other programming languages
- Why are there so many programming languages? Are some languages better at certain things than others?
- Programming languages exist so that humans can give instructions to computers. 
- Programming is about communication
- Programming languages are similar to human spoken languages - there's idioms, dialects, grammar, colloquialisms

## Classification
There are two main ways to classify a programming language: by level or by type (compiled or interpreted)

### By Level
The level describes how close the language is to binary code. Binary code is the
language that computers use internally - made up of 0's and 1's. Low-level
languages, like C, tend to be more difficult for humans to read than other
languages. 

There also also high-level languages such as Java, Python, and Ruby.
High level languages do more of the background tasks for the software developer.

### By Type (compiled or interpreted)
Compiled languages such as C, C++, and Java are converted into binary code
before they are executed.

Interpreted languages can be translated or directly
executed. The code does not get directly converted to binary, the program that
runs the code is the one that communicates direectly with the computer. 

Compiled and interpreted languages can be further divided into dynamically typed and statically typed languages.

Statically typed languages do type checking (verifying/enforcing constraints of types) at compile-time instead of run-time.

Dynamicaly typed languages do type checking at run-time instead of compile-time. 


## Languages

### Python

Python = high-level, dynamically typed language. Created in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. 

Python can be run on a variety of platforms (Mac, Windows, Linux, etc) and is straightforward in terms of syntax. It's syntax is similar to that of the English language. It was designed to be powerful, intuitive, and open source.

Python is widely used for: 
* Server-side Web Development
* Mathematical Operations
* Data Science
* Data Visualizations
* Artificial Intelligence

Ada teaches introductory Object-Oriented programming in Python and server-side web development. 

### HTML & CSS

HTML or Hyper-Text Markup Language is a markup language. CSS or Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language. HTML + CSS work together for structuring and styling the content that make up a web page. 

HTML can be considered as the "skeleton" of a web page. HTML provides the set up and structure of the organization of each web page. CSS is the "clothes" of the skeleton. CSS specifies how each piece of the web page looks including colors, sizes, styles, and relationship to other elements in the web page.
